- [Aim] Digitising and cross-referencing mathematics textbook index pages

## Layout

- PDFs (corresponding to the physical books) are stored under `shelves/`
  by `"{surname}_{firstname}`:
  - e.g. books by "Gilbert Strang" are stored under `shelves/strang_gilbert/`
- â€¦then by `"{year}_{title}"` (where title, potentially including edition number,
  is 'slugged', i.e. constituent spaces are hyphenated):
  - e.g. `1980_linear-algebra-and-its-applications-2e.pdf`
- For both size and copyright reasons, the PDFs themselves only contain index
  pages (fair use) and are not uploaded in this repository.

## Shelves
